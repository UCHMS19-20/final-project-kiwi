# KIWI!

## Description

KIWI! is a game inspired by point and click adventure puzzle flash games I enjoyed as a kid. However, the gameplay is different because the controls are more similar to a platformer. The player will walk around, searching for objects that eventually unlock more parts of the game. In KIWI!, the player is a kiwi bird who travels through time and space in a machine powered by kiwi fruit.
